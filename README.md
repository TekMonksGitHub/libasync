Cross platform Async Library for C++ 

## Why
No comprehensive Async IO library exists for C++. Many exist for Async tasks, or Sockets, but nothing that covers everything. This library will cover

* Async File IO
* Async CPU Intensive IO
* Async Network IO
* Async Extensions

## How to use
Step 1: Download code  
Step 2: Download XForge (needed to build)  
Step 3: xforge -c -f <path>/build/build.xf.js  
Step 4: Doxygen docs are in <path>/docs  
Step 5: Look at <path>/cpp/pmain.cpp for an example  
    
## Want to contribute? Why this exists?
Our goal is to produce a simple and comprehensive C++ async library to make it easier to write

* High performace TCP and UDP servers
* High performance File IO servers
* High performance APIs in C++ 

Sometimes you just need the raw performance of C++ ;)
